## 🦅 Why Oksigenia SOS?

When you are alone in the mountains, technology is your last line of defense. Most safety apps rely on internet connection, proprietary servers, or paid subscriptions. **Oksigenia SOS is different.**

It is an **autonomous bio-telemetry system** designed to detect life-threatening situations (severe falls or prolonged unconsciousness) and automatically trigger a rescue protocol using pure SMS.

* **No Servers:** Your data never leaves your phone.
* **No Internet:** Works via GSM/SMS (2G/3G/4G/5G).
* **No Accounts:** Install, configure, and you are protected.

## 🛡️ What's New in v4.0.0: Smart Sentinel Complete

Closes the multi-sport story started in v3.9.7. Three additions on top of the existing Smart Sentinel v4 algorithm and activity profiles.

### ⚡ Catastrophic Impact Path
A second G-force threshold per profile fires the alarm immediately, skipping the 60-second yellow observation window. The 30-second pre-alert on the alarm screen is still the user's chance to cancel.

| Profile | Yellow (observation) | Orange (direct alarm) |
|:---|:---:|:---:|
| 🥾 Trekking | 6G | **10G** |
| 🚵 Trail / MTB | 8G | **13G** |
| 🧗 Mountaineering | 6G | **10G** |
| 🪂 Paragliding | impact off | impact off |
| 🛶 Kayak | impact off | impact off |
| 👷 Professional | 6G | **10G** |

### 📍 GPS Interval per Profile
Each profile declares its own GPS sampling rate. Slow-motion sports save battery; fast-motion sports get the resolution they need. Applied mid-session when the user changes the active profile.

| Profile | Interval | Distance filter |
|:---|:---:|:---:|
| 🥾 Trekking / 🧗 Mountaineering | 30 s | 30 m |
| 🚵 Trail / MTB / 👷 Professional | 5 s | 10 m |
| 🪂 Paragliding | 2 s | 5 m |
| 🛶 Kayak | 15 s | 20 m |

### 🏠 Home Screen Widgets
Two AppWidgets, native Kotlin, zero new dependencies, zero new permissions.
* **🆘 Panic widget (1×1):** circular SOS button. Tap fires the alarm flow directly with the 30-second pre-alert as safety. Works even if monitoring is currently off — wakes the foreground service if needed.
* **📊 Status widget (2×2):** active profile (with emoji), Sentinel state (green/yellow/orange/red dot), active modes (fall detection, inactivity monitor with configured time, live tracking), battery level. Updates once per minute.

### 🛠️ Resolves Issue #3
[Issue #3](https://github.com/OksigeniaSL/oksigenia-sos/issues/3) reported false positives during paragliding. v4.0.0 ships a Paragliding profile with impact detection disabled entirely; in flight only Inactivity Monitor + manual SOS protect.

See the [v4.0.0 GitHub Release](https://github.com/OksigeniaSL/oksigenia-sos/releases/tag/v4.0.0) for the full technical breakdown.

## 🎯 v3.9.7: Smart Sentinel v4 & Activity Profiles

### 🧠 Smart Sentinel v4 — Cadence-CV Detector
The fall-detection algorithm has been rewritten from scratch using field telemetry collected on Pixel 7a and Pixel 8 phones in pocket while walking real terrain.
* **Horizontal-plane cadence** (`√(effX² + effY²)`) using `userAccelerometerEventStream` — gravity is removed by the platform; vertical bobbing is filtered out.
* **Z-bias EMA filter** (α = 0.998) — corrects a Pixel 8 firmware quirk where the Z axis sticks at ~197 m/s² for several seconds.
* **Runtime Hz measurement** — Pixel 7a delivers 58.8 Hz, Pixel 8 delivers 49.8 Hz (not the 50 Hz the old code assumed). Frequency now self-calibrates per device.
* **CV cap raised to 1.30** (was 0.85) — the wearable literature's "CV ≈ 0.4" is wrong for a phone in a pocket. Median measured CV in real walking is 1.1.
* **Crossing threshold raised to 1.12 m/s²** (was 1.06) — sits above hand-carried noise.
* **File logger** at `app_flutter/sentinel.log` for post-incident analysis.

### 🏃 Activity Profiles
Six presets tune Smart Sentinel sensitivity to match the sport. Pick from the home screen chip or Settings.

| Profile | Impact threshold | Cadence band |
|:---|:---:|:---:|
| 🥾 **Trekking** (default) | Standard | Walking |
| 🚵 **Trail / MTB** | Higher | Wider |
| 🧗 **Mountaineering** | Standard | Slow |
| 🪂 **Paragliding** | Disabled | — |
| 🛶 **Kayak** | Disabled | — |
| 👷 **Professional** | Sensitive | Standard |

Profiles apply mid-session — no restart needed.

### 🛠️ Pixel 7 / Android 14 Stability
* **FGS type fix:** Removed `foregroundServiceType=location` from the manifest (kept `dataSync|mediaPlayback`). The old declaration broke `WatchdogReceiver` background restarts on Android 14+.
* **setMonitoring race:** `_loadSettings` now awaits `toggleInactivityMonitor` and skips the redundant `setMonitoring` event that caused intermittent cold-start failures.

### 🔒 Privacy — Telephony Stack Replaced
The unmaintained `telephony ^0.2.0` package was injecting a transitive `READ_PHONE_STATE` implied permission. Replaced with the active fork `another_telephony ^0.4.1`. APK verified with `aapt dump permissions` — zero phone-state permissions in the release build.

See the [v3.9.7 GitHub Release](https://github.com/OksigeniaSL/oksigenia-sos/releases/tag/v3.9.7) for the full technical breakdown.

## 🥾 v3.9.6: The Trekking Update

### 📡 Live Tracking
Stay connected with your emergency contact even when nothing goes wrong.
* **Periodic SMS check-ins:** Send your GPS position automatically every 30, 60, or 120 minutes.
* **Countdown timer:** "Next check-in in: MM:SS" visible in the status pill and telemetry panel.
* **Pause / Resume:** Temporarily suspend check-ins (e.g. during a rest) without deactivating monitoring.
* **"I'm OK" button:** Manual instant check-in that resets the countdown.
* **Auto-Pause on SOS:** Check-ins suspend automatically when a fall alarm fires, and resume if the alarm is cancelled.

### ⏰ Doze Mode — Verified
After 1 hour of real-world sleep on a locked Pixel 8 running GrapheneOS, the alarm broke through the lock screen correctly. `AlarmManager.alarmClock` is used for scheduling instead of `Timer.periodic` (which freezes in deep Doze). The alarm fires, displays the full-screen countdown, and allows cancellation without unlocking.

### 🧭 Onboarding Overhaul
* **GrapheneOS SMS guide:** Step-by-step instructions for the Android 13+ "Allow restricted settings" flow. The app walks you through the required sequence (denied notice → ⋮ menu → PIN → permissions) that sideloaded apps must follow to gain SMS access.
* **Motion Sensor detection:** Automatically detects if the device's sensor access is disabled (GrapheneOS "Sensors" toggle) and prompts you to enable it before monitoring begins.
* **"Why these permissions?" panel:** Each permission has an explanation. Swipe up the bottom sheet to understand exactly what each permission is used for — and what happens if you deny it.
* **Language selector:** Change the app language directly from the onboarding screen, without navigating to settings.

### 🔒 Privacy Fix
Removed implicit `READ_PHONE_STATE` permission that was being injected by a transitive dependency. The APK no longer requests or implies this permission.

## 🚀 The v3.9.5 Saga: The Immortal Update

This version is not just an update; it is a complete re-engineering of the app's lifecycle and its survival under real field conditions.

### 🏗️ Phase 1: Modernization
We have migrated the entire codebase to **Flutter 3.38**.
* **Zero Technical Debt:** All deprecated libraries have been replaced.
* **Linter Compliance:** The code is clean, strict, and optimized for the latest Android runtimes.

### 💔 Phase 2: The "Great Decoupling"
Previously, the logic lived inside the screen. Now, they are divorced.
* **Headless Architecture:** The UI is now just a "Remote Control".
* **Service Independence:** If you close the UI, **the Service DOES NOT DIE**. It continues monitoring acceleration and inactivity in a separate Isolate.
* **Smart Reconnection:** When you open the app, it asks: *"Is a service already running?"* If yes, it connects to the live stream. If no, it initializes the system.

### 🧛 Phase 3: Deep Sleep Immunity
We fought against Android's Doze Mode and won.
* **CPU Wakelock:** The background service holds a `PARTIAL_WAKE_LOCK` (native Android) to keep the CPU alive for sensor processing even in deep sleep.
* **Battery Gate:** Monitoring cannot be activated unless the app is exempt from battery optimization. This is not a warning — it is a hard block. A single tap opens the system setting to fix it.
* **Zombie Recovery:** If an alarm triggers while the phone is locked, the system recovers instantly on unlock with the correct remaining countdown.

### 🔔 Phase 4: The Alarm Breaks Through
The alarm is now a true emergency signal, not just a notification.
* **Lock Screen Override:** When a fall or inactivity alarm triggers, the app appears directly on top of the lock screen using Android's `fullScreenIntent`. The user can cancel the alarm **without unlocking the phone** — critical when wearing gloves or in cold conditions.
* **No More Frozen Screenshot:** The lock screen no longer shows a static, non-interactive snapshot of the app UI. Normal lock behavior is fully restored when no alarm is active.
* **Screen-On Guarantee:** The alarm forces the screen on and keeps it lit for the full 30-second countdown window.

### 🧠 Phase 5: Smart Sentinel
Intelligent fall detection that eliminates false positives from physical activity.
* **Impact → Observation:** A >3.5G impact does not trigger the alarm immediately. It opens a **60-second silent observation window**.
* **Rhythmic Movement Detection:** Every 2 seconds, the service analyzes the last 60 sensor samples. If it detects rhythmic acceleration crossings (walking, running, cycling), it classifies the event as a false positive and resets silently.
* **True Fall Confirmation:** Only sustained absence of rhythmic movement for 60 seconds triggers the alarm. Falls while hiking, scrambling, or riding do not cause false alerts.
* **Re-arm After Cancel:** The Sentinel re-arms correctly after the user cancels an alarm. The sensor buffer is cleared on reset to prevent stale data from contaminating the next analysis cycle.

## 🧠 Core Features

| Feature | Technical Detail |
|:---|:---|
| **📊 Live Telemetry** | The footer displays real-time sensor data. **G-Force Meter** visualizes acceleration vector sum. **Battery** monitoring triggers an emergency "Dying Gasp" SMS at <5%. |
| **📐 Vector Physics** | **3D Vector Magnitude Calculation** ($\sqrt{x^2+y^2+z^2}$). Smart Sentinel filters walking, running, and cycling as false positives before triggering. |
| **🛡️ Permission Semaphores** | Instantly shows if you are safe. **Green:** Systems Go. **Red:** Critical permission missing. Tapping guides you to the specific Android setting. |
| **🌑 Dictatorship of Dark Mode** | Enforced pure dark theme (OLED friendly). Preserves night vision and maximizes battery life. |
| **🧟 Inactivity Monitor** | Runs fully in the background. Tracks micro-movements even with the screen off. Configurable timeout (hours). |
| **🪫 Dying Gasp** | At battery <5%, automatically sends an SMS with last known GPS coordinates before power death. |

## ⚠️ Critical Configuration

These settings are **required** for Oksigenia SOS to function reliably in the field. The app will not allow monitoring to start until they are configured.

### 🔋 1. Battery Optimization — Unrestricted (Mandatory)
* **Why?** Android kills background processes to save power. Without this, the Sentinel dies after a few hours of inactivity.
* **How:** Long press App Icon → **App Info** → **Battery** → Select **"Unrestricted"** (or "Don't optimize").
* The monitoring toggle will not activate until this is set. Tapping the battery icon opens the correct setting directly.

### 📺 2. Full-Screen Notifications — Allow (Mandatory on Android 14+)
* **Why?** Required for the alarm to appear on top of the lock screen without manual unlock.
* **How:** Go to **Settings → Apps → Oksigenia SOS → Full-screen notifications** → Enable.
* Without this, the alarm audio still plays but the screen does not wake automatically.

### 🛡️ 3. Allow "Restricted Settings" (Android 13+)
* **Why?** Android blocks apps from sending SMS automatically. You must authorize Oksigenia manually.
* **How:** Go to **Settings → Apps → Oksigenia SOS** → Tap **three dots (⋮)** → **"Allow restricted settings"**.
